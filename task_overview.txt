Task Overview:

Our company needs an internal service for its employees to help them decide on a lunch place. Your task is to build a backend service that supports the following features:

System Overview:

Restaurants upload their daily menus via API.
Employees vote on menus using a mobile app (for which the backend needs to be implemented).
The backend must support both old and new versions of the app (the app sends its version in the request headers).
Required APIs:

Authentication
Creating a restaurant
Uploading a menu for the restaurant (there should be a menu for each day)
Creating an employee
Getting the current day's menu
Voting for a restaurant menu
The old API version accepts one menu vote.
The new API version allows users to vote for the top three menus, with respective points (1 to 3).
Getting results for the current day
Technical Requirements:

The solution should be built using Python, preferably with Django Rest Framework (other frameworks are acceptable).
The app should be containerized.
Include project and API documentation.
Implement unit tests.
Extra Points:

High Availability (HA) Cloud Architecture Diagram (preferably on Azure).
Usage of linting and static typing tools.
